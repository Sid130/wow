      The Moon 🌚
    </h1>
    <h3 id="a-ridiculous-liberal-myth">A Ridiculous 👂🗣 Liberal 🤡 Myth 🐉</h3>
    <p>
      It amazes 😉🤙 me that so many 👬 allegedly 🕖 “educated 👨‍🎓⁉🆗” people 👫
      have fallen ⬇ so quickly 🏃💨 and so hard 🍆 for a fraudulent 👇🏻
      fabrication of such laughable 😂 proportions 💱. The very 👌 idea 💡 that
      a gigantic 💪💦 ball ⚽⚾🏀 of rock 🗿 happens 😱❕❔ to orbit 🌂👎🏿 our
      planet 🌎, showing 👀 itself in neat 😫😡, four-week cycles 🤣 – with the
      same side 👳 facing 😀 us 🇺🇸 all 😤 the time ⏰ – is ludicrous 😵.
      Furthermore 🚮🏄🏿👼🏽, it is an insult 🎢🚫 to common 🐩 sense 💰 and a
      damnable 😜 affront to intellectual 👓📖 honesty 🔪 and integrity 😤. That
      people 👨🏿 actually 😳 believe 🌈 it is evidence 📑 that the liberals 😻
      have wrested the last 😍 vestiges of control 🎮 of our public 🍆😞💦
      school 🎓 system 🗺 from decent ✅, God-fearing Americans 🇺🇸😏👌 (as if any
      further 😵 evidence 📑 was needed 😫! Daddy’s 👨 Roommate 🤡? God 😇
      Almighty 🙌!)
    </p>
    <p>
      Documentaries 📝 such as Enemy 😼👌💥 of the State 🇺🇸 have accurately 😳😂
      portrayed ✍ the elaborate 🎈🎍, byzantine ♒ network 🌐 of surveillance 👁
      satellites 🛰📡 that the liberals 🤡 have sent 😳 into space 📡🔭🚀 to spy
      📷 on 💦🤣 law-abiding Americans 🇺🇸. Equipped 💪 with technology 📱
      developed 🚀 by Handgun 🔫 Control 🎛, Inc ✂⁉⚠., these satellites 📡 have
      the ability 👉 to detect 🕵👀 firearms 🔫 from hundreds 🔢 of kilometers
      up ☝. That’s ✔ right ✔, neighbors 🚶🏼‍♀️🏡 .. the next 👉 time 🕐 you’re out
      in the backyard 👅🍑💕 exercising 💪 your 👉 Second 🕑 Amendment 🔫 rights
      👌, the liberals 🤡 will see 👀 it! These satellites 📡 are sensitive 💰
      enough 💦 to tell 🗣 the difference 😡 between 😉 a Colt .45 🔫 and a .38
      ⏹⏺⏏ Special 😲! And when 🕒⏳⏰ they detect 🚨⚠ you 👈 with a firearm 🔫,
      their computers 💻 cross-reference the address 🏠 to figure 🤔 out your 👉
      name 📛, and then an enormous 👲🏽 database 📝📓📕 housed at Berkeley 😤😭
      is updated 🤔 with information 📄 about 🤔 you 👈.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course 😂, this all 💯 works 🏢 fine 😰💦 during the day 📆, but 🔮🍑
      what about 💦 at night 🌙? Even 🌃 the liberals 😻 can’t ❌ control 🎮 the
      rotation ♻📅 of the Earth 🌎 to prevent 🛡🔞 nightfall from setting 📐 in
      (only Joshua 👨🍍 was able 💪 to ask 🙏 for that particular 😪 favor 🤷‍♂️!)
      That’s ✔ where the “moon 🌝” comes 💦 in. Powered 🚨🏍 by nuclear ☢
      reactors ☢, the “moon 🌝” is nothing 🚫 more than an enormous 🔌 balloon
      🤷🏽‍♀️, emitting trillions 💰 of candlepower of gun-revealing light 💡.
      Piloted by key 🗝🔑 members 👦 of the liberal 😻 community 🆗🌎🌍, the
      “moon 🌙” is strategically ❌⭕ moved 📦 across ➡ the country 🏞, pointing
      👉🏻 out those who dare 😡😠 to make 💘 use ✍🏻 of their God-given rights ✔
      at night 🌙🌛🌜!
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes 👍, I 👁 know 🤔 this probably 😻 sounds 👂 paranoid 😰 and
      preposterous 😡😠, but 🍑 consider 👈 this. Despite 🤔🚫 what the
      revisionist 🐈👲🏾 historians 🖼 tell 🗣 you 👉👆, there is no 😣 mention 🗣 of
      the “moon 🌙” anywhere 🌍 in literature 💯😩🍑 or historical 🚫 documents
      😮 – anywhere 🌎 – before 😂 1950. That is when 🍑 it was initially 💇💺
      launched 🚀. When 🍑 President 🇺🇸 Josef Kennedy 😱🤜🏉, at the State 🇺🇸 of
      the Union 🇺🇸 address 📭🏠, proclaimed 🎙 “We choose 🤔 to go 🏃 to the moon
      ‼🌝🌙”, he 👨🏼‍🎓 may 🗓 as well 😦 have said 💬🙈 “We choose 🤔👈 to go 🏃 to
      the weather ❄ balloon 🎈.” The subsequent 😎 faking 😎 of a “moon 🌚”
      landing 🛬 on 🔛 national 🇺🇸 TV 📡💻 was the first 🥇☝ step 🚶 in a long
      😩🍆 history 📜 of the erosion of our constitutional 📃 rights ✔ by
      leftists 😎 in this country 🇺🇸. No 😣 longer 📏 can we hide 🙈 from our
      government 💩 when 🍑 the sun ☀😩🔥 goes 🏃🏿💗 down ⬇.
