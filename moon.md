# The Moon 🌚:

## A Ridiculous 👂🗣 Liberal 🤡 Myth 🐉

It amazes 😉🤙 me that so many 👬 allegedly 🕖 "educated 👨‍🎓⁉🆗" people 👫 have fallen ⬇ so quickly 🏃💨 and so hard 🍆 for a fraudulent 👇🏻 fabrication of such laughable 😂 proportions 💱. The very 👌 idea 💡 that a gigantic 💪💦 ball ⚽⚾🏀 of rock 🗿 happens 😱❕❔ to orbit 🌂👎🏿 our planet 🌎, showing 👀 itself in neat 😫😡, four-week cycles 🤣 -- with the same side 👳 facing 😀 us 🇺🇸 all 😤 the time ⏰ -- is ludicrous 😵. Furthermore 🚮🏄🏿👼🏽, it is an insult 🎢🚫 to common 🐩 sense 💰 and a damnable 😜 affront to intellectual 👓📖 honesty 🔪 and integrity 😤. That people 👨🏿 actually 😳 believe 🌈 it is evidence 📑 that the liberals 😻 have wrested the last 😍 vestiges of control 🎮 of our public 🍆😞💦 school 🎓 system 🗺 from decent ✅, God-fearing Americans 🇺🇸😏👌 (as if any further 😵 evidence 📑 was needed 😫! Daddy's 👨 Roommate 🤡? God 😇 Almighty 🙌!)

Documentaries 📝 such as Enemy 😼👌💥 of the State 🇺🇸 have accurately 😳😂 portrayed ✍ the elaborate 🎈🎍, byzantine ♒ network 🌐 of surveillance 👁 satellites 🛰📡 that the liberals 🤡 have sent 😳 into space 📡🔭🚀 to spy 📷 on 💦🤣 law-abiding Americans 🇺🇸. Equipped 💪 with technology 📱 developed 🚀 by Handgun 🔫 Control 🎛, Inc ✂⁉⚠., these satellites 📡 have the ability 👉 to detect 🕵👀 firearms 🔫 from hundreds 🔢 of kilometers up ☝. That's ✔ right ✔, neighbors 🚶🏼‍♀️🏡 .. the next 👉 time 🕐 you're out in the backyard 👅🍑💕 exercising 💪 your 👉 Second 🕑 Amendment 🔫 rights 👌, the liberals 🤡 will see 👀 it! These satellites 📡 are sensitive 💰 enough 💦 to tell 🗣 the difference 😡 between 😉 a Colt .45 🔫 and a .38 ⏹⏺⏏ Special 😲! And when 🕒⏳⏰ they detect 🚨⚠ you 👈 with a firearm 🔫, their computers 💻 cross-reference the address 🏠 to figure 🤔 out your 👉 name 📛, and then an enormous 👲🏽 database 📝📓📕 housed at Berkeley 😤😭 is updated 🤔 with information 📄 about 🤔 you 👈.

Of course 😂, this all 💯 works 🏢 fine 😰💦 during the day 📆, but 🔮🍑 what about 💦 at night 🌙? Even 🌃 the liberals 😻 can't ❌ control 🎮 the rotation ♻📅 of the Earth 🌎 to prevent 🛡🔞 nightfall from setting 📐 in (only Joshua 👨🍍 was able 💪 to ask 🙏 for that particular 😪 favor 🤷‍♂️!) That's ✔ where the "moon 🌝" comes 💦 in. Powered 🚨🏍 by nuclear ☢ reactors ☢, the "moon 🌝" is nothing 🚫 more than an enormous 🔌 balloon 🤷🏽‍♀️, emitting trillions 💰 of candlepower of gun-revealing light 💡. Piloted by key 🗝🔑 members 👦 of the liberal 😻 community 🆗🌎🌍, the "moon 🌙" is strategically ❌⭕ moved 📦 across ➡ the country 🏞, pointing 👉🏻 out those who dare 😡😠 to make 💘 use ✍🏻 of their God-given rights ✔ at night 🌙🌛🌜!

Yes 👍, I 👁 know 🤔 this probably 😻 sounds 👂 paranoid 😰 and preposterous 😡😠, but 🍑 consider 👈 this. Despite 🤔🚫 what the revisionist 🐈👲🏾 historians 🖼 tell 🗣 you 👉👆, there is no 😣 mention 🗣 of the "moon 🌙" anywhere 🌍 in literature 💯😩🍑 or historical 🚫 documents 😮 -- anywhere 🌎 -- before 😂 1950. That is when 🍑 it was initially 💇💺 launched 🚀. When 🍑 President 🇺🇸 Josef Kennedy 😱🤜🏉, at the State 🇺🇸 of the Union 🇺🇸 address 📭🏠, proclaimed 🎙 "We choose 🤔 to go 🏃 to the moon ‼🌝🌙", he 👨🏼‍🎓 may 🗓 as well 😦 have said 💬🙈 "We choose 🤔👈 to go 🏃 to the weather ❄ balloon 🎈." The subsequent 😎 faking 😎 of a "moon 🌚" landing 🛬 on 🔛 national 🇺🇸 TV 📡💻 was the first 🥇☝ step 🚶 in a long 😩🍆 history 📜 of the erosion of our constitutional 📃 rights ✔ by leftists 😎 in this country 🇺🇸. No 😣 longer 📏 can we hide 🙈 from our government 💩 when 🍑 the sun ☀😩🔥 goes 🏃🏿💗 down ⬇.
